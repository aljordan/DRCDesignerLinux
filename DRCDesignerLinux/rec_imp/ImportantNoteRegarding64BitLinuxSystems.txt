Because rec_imp was compiled for 32 bit systems, it will fail on modern 64 bit Linux systems.
In order to get it to run on 64 bit linux systems, extra packages will have to be installed.

Below are the packages needed to run rec_imp on 64 bit Ubuntu 14.04 variations:
libasound2:i386, libjack0:i386, lib32stdc++6 lib32z1, lib32z1-dev, libasound2-plugins:i386

Install them with the following commands:
sudo apt-get install libasound2:i386
sudo apt-get install libjack0:i386
sudo apt-get install lib32stdc++6 lib32z1 lib32z1-dev
sudo apt-get install libasound2-plugins:i386
