# This fork

I was unable to use DRCDesignerLinux anymore because getting the x86 libraries for `rec_imp` to work on my linux machine was nearly impossible one day. I decided to rebuild `rec_imp` one day and created that fork therefore.
I also created pull requests to the original repository [aljordan/DRCDesignerLinux](https://github.com/aljordan/DRCDesignerLinux "aljordan/DRCDesignerLinux")
